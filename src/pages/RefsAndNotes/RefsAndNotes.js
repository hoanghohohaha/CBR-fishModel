These data are furnished with the understanding that the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) makes no warranties concerning the accuracy, reliability, or suitability for any particular purpose. The datasets were not designed for this type of use.

        <Typography align='left' variant='body1'>Smoothing attempts to allocate the redds or carcasses more realistically in time. Since redds and carcasses are surveyed intermittently, the true timing of these events is lost. This process distributes any non-zero count of redds on a particular day back in time uniformly to the previous non-zero count day. The first day with non-zero counts is distributed back in time 6 days.</Typography>
